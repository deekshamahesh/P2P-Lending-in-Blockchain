METHODOLOGY:
A smart contract lottery system uses a manager to deploy the contract onto the Ethereum blockchain. A participant, known as a player, engages in the lottery by depositing 1 ether into the system. A minimum of three players are required to maintain the system. The manager uses the "pickWinner()" function to randomly select a winner, and the entire balance is transferred to the winner. This decentralized platform facilitates lending activities.

SOFTWARE TOOLS:
Remix IDE
Solidity Programming Language
Metamask 

CONCLUSION:
The project aims to develop a decentralized P2P lending system using Solidity smart contracts. Future enhancements include scalability, integration with Oracles, enhanced user experience, asset tokenization, regulatory compliance, and community governance. These improvements will enable the platform to accommodate larger transactions and users, expand lending opportunities, ensure legal viability, and empower individuals to participate in the DeFi landscape. The project aims to create a robust, inclusive, and sustainable platform for financial services.
